This project aims to embed a kernel of the language of the sequencer
Antescofo (http://repmus.ircam.fr/antescofo) in ReactiveML.

To compile, just type make (clean with make clean). Applications are
the following:
 - asco.rml.native: the sequencer
 - piano_phase.rml.native: Steve Reich's Piano Phase with graphical interface
 - frere_jacques.rml.native: a famous French musical round

These applications communicate with the listening machine of Antescofo
and the audio environment through UDP messages. A stand alone MacOS
application that play both roles is available at:
  http://reactiveml.org/reactive_asco/resources/ascoDemo.app.tar.gz

To launch the sequencer, execute the following command (options can be
displayed with "./asco.rml.native -help"):
  ./asco.rml.native examples/bach.mid.asco

To use it with ascoDemo.app, launch the application, select the
correct score and press play.

A session of live coding is also available in lib/rising_sun.rml.
