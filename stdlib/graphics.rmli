exception Graphic_failure of string
(** Raised by the functions below when they encounter an error. *)


(** {6 Initializations} *)

val open_graph : string -> unit
(** Show the graphics window or switch the screen to graphic mode.
   The graphics window is cleared and the current point is set
   to (0, 0). The string argument is used to pass optional
   information on the desired graphics mode, the graphics window
   size, and so on. Its interpretation is implementation-dependent.
   If the empty string is given, a sensible default is selected. *)

val size_x : unit -> int
(** See {!Graphics.size_y}. *)

val size_y : unit -> int

   an error. The origin (0,0) is at the lower left corner. *)

   blue component. *)

(** {6 Images} *)

type image
(** The abstract type for images, in internal representation.
   Externally, images are represented as matrices of colors. *)

val transp : color
(** In matrices of colors, this color represent a ``transparent''
   point: when drawing the corresponding image, all pixels on the
   screen corresponding to a transparent pixel in the image will
   not be modified, while other points will be set to the color
   of the corresponding point in the image. This allows superimposing
   an image over an existing background. *)

val make_image : color array array -> image
(** Convert the given color matrix to an image.
   Each sub-array represents one horizontal line. All sub-arrays
   must have the same length; otherwise, exception [Graphic_failure]

(** [create_image w h] returns a new image [w] pixels wide and [h]
   pixels tall, to be used in conjunction with [blit_image].
   The initial image contents are random, except that no point
   is transparent. *)

val blit_image : image -> int -> int -> unit
(** [blit_image img x y] copies screen pixels into the image [img],
   modifying [img] in-place. The pixels copied are those inside the
   rectangle with lower left corner at [x,y], and width and height
   equal to those of the image. Pixels that were transparent in
   [img] are left unchanged. *)


(** {6 Mouse and keyboard events} *)

type status =
  { mouse_x : int;              (** X coordinate of the mouse *)
    mouse_y : int;              (** Y coordinate of the mouse *)
    button : bool;              (** true if a mouse button is pressed *)
    keypressed : bool;          (** true if a key has been pressed *)
    key : char;                 (** the character for the key pressed *)
  }
(** To report events. *)


type event =
    Button_down                 (** A mouse button is pressed *)
  | Button_up                   (** A mouse button is released *)
  | Key_pressed                 (** A key is pressed *)
  | Mouse_motion                (** The mouse is moved *)
  | Poll                        (** Don't wait; return immediately *)
(** To specify events to wait for. *)


val wait_next_event : event list -> status
(** Wait until one of the events specified in the given event list
   occurs, and return the status of the mouse and keyboard at
   that time. If [Poll] is given in the event list, return immediately
   with the current status. If the mouse cursor is outside of the
   graphics window, the [mouse_x] and [mouse_y] fields of the event are
   outside the range [0..size_x()-1, 0..size_y()-1]. Keypresses
   are queued, and dequeued one by one when the [Key_pressed]
   event is specified. *)

(** {6 Mouse and keyboard polling} *)

val mouse_pos : unit -> int * int
(** Return the position of the mouse cursor, relative to the
   graphics window. If the mouse cursor is outside of the graphics
   window, [mouse_pos()] returns a point outside of the range
   [0..size_x()-1, 0..size_y()-1]. *)

val button_down : unit -> bool
(** Return [true] if the mouse button is pressed, [false] otherwise. *)

val read_key : unit -> char
(** Wait for a key to be pressed, and return the corresponding
   character. Keypresses are queued. *)

(** Return [true] if a keypress is available; that is, if [read_key]
   would not block. *)


(** {6 Sound} *)

val sound : int -> int -> unit
(** [sound freq dur] plays a sound at frequency [freq] (in hertz)
   for a duration [dur] (in milliseconds). *)

(** {6 Double buffering} *)

val auto_synchronize : bool -> unit
(** By default, drawing takes place both on the window displayed
   on screen, and in a memory area (the ``backing store'').
   The backing store image is used to re-paint the on-screen
   window when necessary.

   To avoid flicker during animations, it is possible to turn
   off on-screen drawing, perform a number of drawing operations
   in the backing store only, then refresh the on-screen window
   explicitly.

   [auto_synchronize false] turns on-screen drawing off.  All
   subsequent drawing commands are performed on the backing store
   only.

   [auto_synchronize true] refreshes the on-screen window from
   the backing store (as per [synchronize]), then turns on-screen
   drawing back on.  All subsequent drawing commands are performed
   both on screen and in the backing store.

   The default drawing mode corresponds to [auto_synchronize true]. *)

val synchronize : unit -> unit
(** Synchronize the backing store and the on-screen window, by
   copying the contents of the backing store onto the graphics
   window. *)


val display_mode : bool -> unit
(** Set display mode on or off. When turned on, drawings are done
   in the graphics window; when turned off, drawings do not affect
   the graphics window.  This occurs independently of
   drawing into the backing store (see the function {!Graphics.remember_mode}
   below). Default display mode is on. *)


val remember_mode : bool -> unit
(** Set remember mode on or off. When turned on, drawings are done
   in the backing store; when turned off, the backing store is
   unaffected by drawings.  This occurs independently of drawing
   onto the graphics window (see the function {!Graphics.display_mode} above).
   Default remember mode is on.  *)
